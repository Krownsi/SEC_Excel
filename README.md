To Do:
Find the most suitable indicators. Currently using:  
    Aroon and MACD for buy signals. When green (recent high) indicator crosses the recent low, if MACD line is above signal line, indicates a good bull run. Checking Volume and RSI, if RSI is below 60 points and the volume is trading above 400k (penny), 1.2M (blue chip), good signal to buy.
    
    Will incorporate Microsoft Azure's Logic App code for scheduling purposes.
